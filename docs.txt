Questions
    1)What is Service?
        -it is application component which can perform long running
        operation in background
        -doesn't have ui
        -once started might continue running even if app destroy
        -a component can bind to service to interact with it and
        even IPC(inter process communication)
        -service can handle
            -network transactions
            -play music
            -perform IO
            -interact with content provider
        all from background
        -it start in main thread of hosting process
            -so you must run any blocking operation in other thread
            to avoid AVR errors
        -don't use IntentService
